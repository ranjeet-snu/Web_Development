When it comes to learning CSS, there are 4 words you need to know: selector, declaration, property, and value. 
CSS connects rules to HTML elements. The rules, made up of selectors and declarations, instruct the browser on how to display the content of certain elements:

The selector specifies which HTML element that rule will apply to. If you add commas in between, as we have in the example,
that rule will apply to all the elements named.

The declaration governs how the specified elements are to be styled. 

Properties specify which feature of the element you wish to style, e.g. font, width, height, color.

Values indicate what setting you want the feature set at. In the example above, 
the color of the text is set to red, in turn making the selected text appear red in the browser window.

<p style="color:yellow"> 1</p>    --- here p is selector and color is property and yellow is value and  style="color:yellow" is declaration
